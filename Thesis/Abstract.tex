With the rise of publicly available Knowledge Graphs (KG) came also a need to harvest these large amounts of data in efficient ways to solve interesting problems in the domain of 
Natural language processing. One problem, in particular, is Question Answering over Knowledge Bases (QAKB). However, one way to solve this problem, is by combining multiple 
components each responsible for solving a different subtask [10]. This paper we present an efficient approach to solving one of these subtasks, namely Candidates Generation (CG). 
Assuming that entities and relations mentioned in a given input sentence are already extracted, we rely on sentence embeddings determine the most probable referred to entities and 
relations. Finally, we will assess the performance of the provided component as a standalone system as well as its performance as a component of an entity linking system, specifically the enhancements it introduces downstream.
